# Bitbucket Pull Request: Mark files as reviewed

This extension brings you a fantastic feature of [Github](https://github.blog/2019-07-01-mark-files-as-viewed/) and an announced one for [Bitbucket cloud
](https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/BCLOUD-19679): mark individual files of a pull request as reviewed.

This extension only works with the new beta pull request experience of Atlassian Bitbucket cloud. You can enable this feature [via a lab](https://bitbucket.org/blog/bitbuckets-new-code-review-offers-reviewers-a-fast-track-to-approving-changes).

We use the [collapsible diffs](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/try-the-new-pull-request-experience-in-bitbucket/#ThenewpullrequestexperienceinBitbucket-Collapsiblediffs) feature as a way to mark files as reviewed and style them accordingly.

(!) important: files that are marked reviewed and later on are changed will not be unmarked as reviewed.

(!) important: won't work with Pull Request option "Load files" set to "Individually"
