# Bitbucket Pull Request: Mark files as reviewed

Short: bb-pr-markfilesreviewed

This extensions bring you a fantastic feature of [Github](https://github.blog/2019-07-01-mark-files-as-viewed/) and an announced one for [Bitbucket cloud](https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/BCLOUD-19679). 

This extension only works with the new beta pull request experience of Atlassian Bitbucket cloud. You can enable this feature [via a lab](https://bitbucket.org/blog/bitbuckets-new-code-review-offers-reviewers-a-fast-track-to-approving-changes).

We use the "collapsible diffs" feature as a way to mark files as reviewed and style them appropriately.

(!) important: files that are marked reviewed and later on are changed will not be unmarked as reviewed. This should be part of the official feature of course.
